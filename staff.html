  <h3>Ally Gold: Director of Development</h3>
<p>Allison Leigh Godsey is a top dog Senior at UNCW. Even though she was born and raised in Wilmington, North Carolina, she has lived in Los Angeles serving in the US Coast Guard and New York City interning at Them Media. After a year as Party Coordinator and Extraordinaire for Visions Film Festival and Conference, she was promoted to Director of Development.  On top of behind the scenes festival work, she has also directed shorts that have been shown in film festivals such as Surfalorus and Cucalorus.  After her final year of college, she is planning to move back to New York where she hopes to work in the producing field of film. When she’s not in class or developing things, you can find her surfing, traveling the world, rolling in sand with her amazing Golden Retriever Moose, causing ruckus on Craigslist, getting anxiety from thinking about the amount of control we don’t have, or blowing people’s minds with her deep revelations. Her most loved epiphany states, “if you blew up right now, you wouldn’t know it.”</p>

  <h3>Joshua Marshburn: Development Assistant and Fundraising Coordinator</h3>
<p>He is an octopus dreaming he is an ape in early summer. Let your senses give you the details of his body. Let his works give you the details of his mind. He seems incapable of making straight lines. He has stopped trying to make them. He is older than he was. He is younger than he will be. Thus he has power. Eight is his number. It has infinite potential. He wants the films he will make to be colorful, syrupy, lurid, psychosexual, and melismatic. He also dreams of directing a James Bond film. And a musical. He is. You may call him Joshua.</p>

During her time at UNCW, she has developed a deep interest in documentaries and narratives and continues to experiment in various departments of film production. After years of attending local film festivals, she decided to take Visions with hopes of contributing to such an inspirational and awe-inspiring event from behind the scenes. In addition to living within the wonderful world of film, she loves people, maps, hugs, theater, and ice cream.</p>
