          <h2>How do I submit?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>There are two options for submission. This year Visions Film  Festival & Conference will accept film via Film Freeway. A link to Film Freeway as well as instructions on how to use Film Freeway can be found under the “submit” tab. Presentation proposals will be accepted via email to <a href="mailto:submissions@visionsfilm.org">submissions@visionsfilm.org</a>. When submissions open, forms for papers can be found as .pdf attachments under the “submit” tab. If your film is selected, we will request a copy of your film in an H.264 file. Instructions on exporting can be found under the “submit” tab.</p>
          </div>
          <h2>Can I submit more than one film or paper?</h2>
          <div>
            <p>You can submit as many papers or films as you like! There is no cap in place, so if you have multiple projects you feel strongly about, we encourage you to share them with us. Each film submission will need its own registration fee.</p>
